        <p class="wow bounce">We as South Sudan Environmental Advocates (SSEA) love and desire the earth where
          manufacturing industries are not in conflict with Mother Nature and biodiversity in
          whatever way possible on this planet. We want both manufacturing industries and
          Mother Nature to be in amicable state where none of the two is an enemy for the
          extinction of the other. Furthermore, as you know, today we live in a culture that has
          been significantly shaped by the forces of industries. We live in a world that has come to
          place an extreme value on the consumption of material goods. However, the
          environmental cost of this kind of lifestyle is not always consider. To manufacture any
          single good, there are long chain of processes that should also be accounted for when
          considering the environmental cost of anything. Industries are a major contributing
          factors to water pollution across the world. The illegal dumping of contaminated water,
          gases, chemicals, heavy metals or radioactive materials into major water bodies are
          causing daily huge damage to marine life and the entire environment. For instance, the
          steel production, has a big impact on the environment, including air, emissions,
          wastewater contaminants, hazardous wastes and solid wastes. The massive
          environmental impacts from integrated steel mills are from coking and iron-making. So
          we as (SSEA) are working in collaboration with various industries, government
          institutions concerned and environmental organizations to address these challenges
          facing environment from activities of manufacturing industries in South Sudan</p>
