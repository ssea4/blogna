        <p>As South Sudan Environmental Advocates (SSEA). We appreciate and know that the
          environmental benefits of infrastructure are manifold and sustainable infrastructure
          assets can help to address climate and natural disasters, reduce greenhouse gas
          emissions, contamination, manage natural capital and enhance resource efficiency.
          Furthermore, the infrastructure plays a significant role in the development and
          protection of energy sector and biodiversity respectively. Moreover, the national economy need reliable infrastructure to connect supply chains and efficiently move
          goods and services across borders. Infrastructure link households across the urban and
          rural settings which help in the creation of employment opportunities, mobility,
          healthcare and education. Clean energy and public transit can assist in reducing
          greenhouse gases. Finally, we as South Sudan Environmental Advocates (SSEA) are
          involved in the planting of trees across the country including alongside the
          infrastructure like highways, airports and etc. We have a goal to plant three Million
          trees in the period of ten years across South Sudan and to help in the fight against
          desertification, soil erosion, deforestation and beautification of roads and airports by
          planting trees along all the highways and airports in South Sudan. So we are working in
          collaboration with Ministry of environment and other Mother Nature organizations like
          CLENA SUSTAINABLE FUTURE and United Nationsâ€™ agencies.</p>
