        <p class="wow bounce"><strong>Environmental Impact Assessment </strong><br>
          There is need for environmental impact assessment in the country, audits, monitoring and
          evaluation to mitigate adverse impacts and enhance environmental benefits. So far a lot of the
          development activities taking place in South Sudan do not adhere to environmental regulations
          accepted worldwide and leave the environment polluted, degraded and risk the lives of the
          communities living nearby.
          SSEA thus seeks to offer consultancy on the adherence of international and local environmental
          regulations. This will ensure that development does not lead to environmental degradation and
          avoid companies being liable in future for damage done in the course of their activities.<br>
          <strong>Environmental Audit </strong><br>
          This is a compliance audit done as the specific laws dictate to ensure compliance to the
          environmental impact assessment report given. its an assessment of the extent to which an
          organization is observing practices which harm the environment.

          implementation gaps, along with related corrective actions.<br>
